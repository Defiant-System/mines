### How to play
Mouse left click to open a tile, right click to flag a mine. (**If 
you use a one button mouse or the trackpad, use Command(âŒ˜)-click 
or Control(^)-click instead of right click**) Left click on a number
to quickly open all surrounding tiles if the number matches surrounding flags.

### Goal
You start with an empty field and have to uncover squares one at a time. 
Underneath each is either a space, a number, or a mine. The numbers tell 
you how many mines are in the adjacent boxes, the mines kill you dead. To 
win, you have to clear the field without touching a mine. The timer starts
as soon as you click on a square. There are three levels - below is the list of
differences of each level. Good luck!
